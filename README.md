## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Video Cards**: Video cards are generated dynamically using JavaScript, displaying randomized titles, channels, views, and timestamps.
- **Hover Effects**: Video cards have smooth hover effects for a modern look.
- **Sticky Header**: The header remains at the top of the page when scrolling.
- **Sign Up / Sign In**: A button that directs users to the authentication page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including hover effects and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamically generating the video cards.
- **Google Fonts**: The Roboto font is used for styling the text.


### HTML (`index.html`)
The HTML file contains the structure of the website, including the header, video container, and JavaScript integration.

### CSS (Embedded)
CSS styles are embedded directly within the HTML file, handling the layout, color scheme, and responsiveness.

### JavaScript (Embedded)
The JavaScript code dynamically generates 40 video cards, creating a mockup of a video gallery.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository or download the project files**.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. You should see the YouTube-like interface with dynamically generated video cards.
4. Click the "Sign Up / Sign In" button to be directed to the authentication page.

## Future Improvements

Here are some possible enhancements that can be made to the project:
- **Sign Up / Sign In Functionality**: Integrate with Firebase or another authentication service to handle user authentication.
- **Video Player Page**: Create a dedicated page for playing individual videos.
- **Backend Integration**: Connect with a backend service to fetch real video data instead of using random placeholders.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhance the responsiveness for a better mobile experience.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Add a toggle to switch between dark and light themes.
